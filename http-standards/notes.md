# Notes

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.
It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol,
which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched,
for instance, text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
